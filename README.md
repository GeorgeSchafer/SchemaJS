# SchemaJS

I was tired of re-writing schema for code validation in ES6, so I wrote a class so you don't have to.

## How to use

Copy-paste the Schema.postman file into your test(s) in Postman to access them. Run it.

## Why?

AJV already has schema-creation methods, but navigating the CommonJS syntax is such a headache when ES6 is available. Also, I wanted to implement something that has a degree of error checking (hence the inclusion of my EnumJS project). It was a fantastic mental exercise.
